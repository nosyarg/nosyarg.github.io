<h1> Research by Topic </h1>

<h3> Random Graphs </h3><br />

In Summer 2018 I participated in the DOMath REU at Duke under the supervision of <a href="https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/">Rick Durrett</a> and <a href="https://www.mathjunge.com/">Matthew Junge</a>.
This project continued through the next year as an independent research course.
We studied random processes on graphs including epidemics on Galton-Watson trees, epidemics on random networkswith infection avoidance, and two-type annihilating particle systems on certain network topologies.
This work led two two papers, one of which was posted on ArXiv, and the other was published in Stochastic Processes and their Applications.<br>

<h3> Gerrymandering </h3>

During the summer of 2020, I participated in the Data+ REU at Duke under the supervision of <a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/jonathan.mattingly">Jonathan Mattingly</a>, <a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/gjh">Greg Herschlag</a>, <a href="https://www.nickeubank.com/">Nick Eubank</a>, and <a href="https://www.ericautry.com/">Eric Autry</a>. During this project we worked on the <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/quantifyinggerrymandering/">Quantifying Gerrymandering</a> project. We used dimensionality reduction to study the ways in which the voting patterns of the North Carolina population have changed in recent years, and how congressional district lines can alter the way in which these changes are expressed in electoral outcomes.

<h3> Tiling Theory </h3>

From Spring 2021 through Spring of 2022, I worked on a project in tiling theory with <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~reif/">John Reif</a>. 
In this project we showed that a nondeterministic 2-dimensional tiling system is capable of simulating a general Turing Machine. 
The resulting paper served as my master's thesis.
