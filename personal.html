<h3>Poker</h3>

I play poker both online and live. Live I have played in several casinos around the US playing both tournaments and cash games. Online I play primarily on ACR and Ignition, mostly $10-$15 buyin MTT's. You can find me on <a href="https://www.sharkscope.com/#Player-Statistics//networks/WPN/players/nosyarg">Sharkscope</a>.

<h3>Climbing</h3>

I have recently started rock climbing at Cliffs of Id and LA Boulders. I have yet to climb a V3, but that is a work in progress.

<h3>Video Games</h3>

My favorite genres are roguelikes and strategy. Recent favorites have included Slay the Spire and Civilization VI.
