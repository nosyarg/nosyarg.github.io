<h3>Poker</h3>

<p class="pageitem">
<img class="pageimage" src="imgs/playingpokerpic.jpg">

I play poker both online and live. Live I have played in several casinos around the US playing both tournaments and cash games. 
  Online I play primarily on ACR and Ignition. 
  You can find my ACR tournament results on <a href="https://www.sharkscope.com/#Player-Statistics//networks/WPN/players/nosyarg">Sharkscope</a>.
  Recently I have also been added to <a href="https://pokerdb.thehendonmob.com/player.php?a=r&n=1390957">Hendon Mob</a>.
